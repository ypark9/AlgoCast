Lexical environment: where something sits physically in the code you write.
                    where is the code located? Where you put things.

Execution context: a Wrapper to help manage the code that is running.
                There are lots of lexical environments. 
                which one is currently running is managed via execution contexts.
                It can contain things beyond what you've written in your code.
